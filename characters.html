    <h1>Characters</h1>

    <p>Here's where I collage art of my favourite OCs as an incentive to keep drawing them. Every time I draw a sexualized character I take a shot (of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid">silly juice</a>).</p>
    
    <div class="box">
        <a href="#vindi">Vindicyrus Ali</a>
    </div>

    <h2 id="vindi">Vindicyrus Ali</h2>
    <p>First things first, here's my <strong>Vindicyrus Ali</strong>, a 6'7" goth mommy demon called an Indhara. More drawings and lore coming... eventually.</p>
    <div class="box" style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; gap: 6px;">
