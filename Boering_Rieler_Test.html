    <h1>Boering-Rieler Test</h1>
    
    <p>The <strong>Boering-Rieler Test</strong>, devised by Charlie Boering and Jane Rieler, aims to deduce whether a living creature exhibiting behaviour indicative of consciousness (i.e. negative reactions to harm) indeed has conscious experience. A creature that fails the test is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie">philosophical zombie</a> (or "p-zombie").</p>
    <p>Rieler used the Boering-Rieler Test as the basis for her <a href="Doll_machine">doll machine</a> thought experiment.</p>

    <blockquote>An entity that fails the test is no more than a realistic automata. They sense pain like a camera senses light. They may seem to express emotions, but there is nothing behind those eyes.</blockquote>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <p>two halls, near the end of either is an electronic screen displaying the end of the other as if it were being viewed from that hallway. a member of the species being tested is restrained such that they can simultaneously look down both hallways, then another member is killed at the end of one hallway. the restrained member is then let free to run down one hallway of their choice. if they pick the one with the screen depicting the death, they are conscious. if they pick the one that actually has the death but merely displays a blank area, they are consciousless.</p>
    <p>Boering and Rieler have only speculated on why this is the case, saying ...</p>

    <h2>Shortcomings</h2>
    <p>the test requires the subject be capable of locomotion; this effectively excludes plants from testing.</p>
    <p>The test also requires two creatures, one of which is required to be killed, thus excluding <a href="Anomalous_Entity_Classification">Class-C</a> entities.</p>
