    <h1>Boering-Rieler Test</h1>
    
    <p>The <strong>Boering-Rieler Test</strong>, devised by Charlie Boering and Jane Rieler, aims to deduce whether a living creature exhibiting behaviour indicative of consciousness (i.e. negative reactions to harm) indeed has conscious experience. A creature that fails the test is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie">philosophical zombie</a> (or "p-zombie").</p>
    <p>Rieler used the Boering-Rieler Test as the basis for her <a href="Doll_machine">doll machine</a> thought experiment.</p>

    <blockquote>An entity that fails the test is no more than a realistic automata. They sense pain like a camera senses light. They may seem to express emotions, but there is nothing behind those eyes.</blockquote>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <p>The most standard form of the test describes a room with two adjacent halls, where near the end of either is an electronic screen displaying the end of the other as if it were being viewed from that hallway. A member of the species being tested is restrained such that they can simultaneously look down both hallways, then another member is killed at the end of one hallway. Because of the screens, it appears as if the creature was killed in the opposite hallway that they actually were. The restrained member is then released to examine one hallway of their choice. If they pick the one with the screen depicting the death, but which in truth is actually empty, they are conscious. If they pick the one that actually has the death but appears as a blank hallway, they are unconscious.</p>
    <p>Boering and Rieler have only speculated on why this is the case, saying ...</p>
    <p>A variation of the Boering-Rieler Test exists that replaces the screens with speakers, testing the consciousness of creatures that lack vision but still possess the ability to hear.</p>

    <h2>Shortcomings</h2>
    <p>the test requires the subject be capable of locomotion and sight (or in some versions, hearing); among other things, this effectively excludes plants from testing. Additionally, the test observes the interaction between two mortal creatures, thus excluding <a href="Anomalous_Entity_Classification">Class-C</a> entities.</p>
