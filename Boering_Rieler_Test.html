    <h1>Boering-Rieler Test</h1>
    
    The <strong>Boering-Rieler Test</strong>, devised by Charlie Boering and Jane Rieler, aims to deduce whether a living creature exhibiting behaviour indicative of consciousness (i.e. negative reactions to harm) indeed has conscious experience. A creature that fails the test is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie">philosophical zombie</a> (or "p-zombie").

    <blockquote>An entity that fails the test is no more than a realistic automata. They sense pain like a camera senses light. They may seem to express emotions, but there is nothing behind those eyes.</blockquote>
