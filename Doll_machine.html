    <h1>Doll machine</h1>
    
    <p>A <strong>doll machine</strong> is a hypothetical contraption first described by <a>Jane Rieler</a>J in May of 2006 that takes in inorganic matter and creates a living, albeit unconscious, creature. Its successful creation would challenge the standing theory that conscious and unconscious beings come into being the same way (i.e. naturally).</p>
    <p>Rieler uses the term doll in multiple talks, the earliest in 2002, as an analogy for "something that resembles a conscious being, but isn't one itself." This analogy is what led her to later propose the doll machine thought experiment.</p>

    <!--<h2>Thought experiment</h2>-->

    <h2>Implications</h2>
    <blockquote>If a doll machine was made, and it was proven that a machine that can produce consciousness cannot be made, then there must be a god. But if conscious life can arise naturally without godly intervention, we should be able to replicate that process.</blockquote>
