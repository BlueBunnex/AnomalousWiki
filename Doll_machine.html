    <h1>Doll machine</h1>
    
    <p>A <strong>doll machine</strong> is a hypothetical contraption first described by Jane Rieler in 2006 that takes in inorganic matter and creates a living, albeit consciousless, creature.</p>
    <p>Rieler uses the term doll in multiple talks, the earliest in 2002, as an analogy for "something that resembles a conscious being, but isn't one itself." This analogy is what led her to propose the doll machine thought experiment.</p>
