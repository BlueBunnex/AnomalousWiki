    <h1>Doll machine</h1>
    
    <p>A <strong>doll machine</strong> is a hypothetical contraption first described by <a>Jane Rieler</a> in May of 2006 that takes in inorganic matter and creates a living, albeit unconscious, creature. Its successful creation, alongside the absence of a consciousness-producing variant, would challenge the standing theory that conscious and unconscious beings come into being the same way (naturally), and for the same reason (survival).</p>
    <p>Rieler uses the term doll in multiple talks, the earliest in 2002, as an analogy for "something that resembles a conscious being, but isn't one itself." This analogy is what led her to later propose the doll machine thought experiment.</p>
    <p>Some speculate that dolls have already been artificially created in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artifical intelligence</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">cellular automata</a>, and so forth, while others argue that Rieler's description only lends itself to organic life.</p>

    <h2>Implications</h2>
    <blockquote>If a doll machine was made, and it was proven that a machine that can produce consciousness cannot be made, then there must be a god. But if conscious life can arise naturally without godly intervention, we should be able to replicate that process.</blockquote>
    <cite>Jane Rieler</cite>

    <h2>Controversy</h2>
    <p>Rieler faced criticism from both her colleagues and the broader scientific community for repeatedly implying a connection between consciousness and the divineâ€”or rather, the arising of conscious life from unconscious life being more than just an evolutionary benefit.</p>
