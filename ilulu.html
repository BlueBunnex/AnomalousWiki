        The format for this will be various paragraphs accompanied by AI generated images that illustrate the story at that moment (pardon if the image doesn't match the descriptions in the scene exactly, AI-san is trying their best). All of the writing is my own. Also, I've never watched season 2, lol.

    <p>It was a short day in August, and as the sky oranged and the wedding ended the bride stepped away noiselessly. The courtyard of the church was glowing with autumn light, her elevated heels clacked against the uneven square cobbles, and she brought herself to a rough, worn iron bench, ornate with angels and dragons, and she sat underneath the trees. The wind picked up, bending the air and surging as if through a wire, and once it settled there was Tohru putting a hand on her shoulder.</p>
    <p>"You did well. You're doing well," she spoke immediately, and took a seat beside Ilulu. "You stopped him. The sun is out now."</p>
    <p>"Bite it," Ilulu snapped, her eyes fiery and tearless. "Having me do this for some humans? For you? I never liked him." The wind licked her bare shoulders, cold and unmagical. She cupped her breasts that were warm, fiery and warm, but it felt different because she was no longer only hers.</p>
    <p>The ceremony had went by as expected, even flawlessly some might say, though there was no processional, because the groom was long dead. Thus it was a ceremony is a parallel sense, but a sealing of fate nonetheless.</p>
    <p>Tohru tried to put on a smile. "I can't thank you enough."</p>
    <p>"Thank you, thank you, thank you!? Are you still yammering?" Ilulu cried. "Why couldn't YOU marry the stupid moon? Last I checked, you're a Chaos Dragon too." She threw out her elbow and struck Tohru in the arm, but Tohru did not retaliate. Ilulu started up into the center of the courtyard and swore, wisps of flame darting from her lips and dissolving into the air. Her back bulged and writhed and a terrible ripping of fabric was heard as coal-black wings erupted from her narrow frame, her top fluttering off her with the damage to its construction. Her breasts were huge and firm with red-hot gas, and with one more uninterpretable cry she shot into the air, her wings heaving air with great, deep bellows of sound. The cobblestones beneath where she took off were blackened and angry.</p>
    <p>Tohru looked at the spot a moment longer, then let her head hang back. Before she could fully reflect on what had happened, a clamour of footfall indicated that the rest of the attendants were beginning to make their way out. Tohru would have to save Ilulu from the embarrassment of what had really happened. She decided to bottle up her feelings for later.</p>
    <p>"Tooohhruu..!"</p>

    <!--
        Basically, she married the ancient spirit of Mehnot in order to quell a curse. His mummified corpse is locked up in the dragon world.
        Something causes her to return to the dragon world, maybe against her will?

        Tohru offered to have her for dinner, but she turned it down.

        she then flies off to the forest and stays there for the night, gorging herself on stolen food for comfort

        She's snarky, and aggressive, and of Chaos. The sun washes out the moon all day, after all, but an eclipse only happens so often.
