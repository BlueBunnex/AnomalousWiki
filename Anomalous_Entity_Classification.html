    <h1>Anomalous Entity Classification</h1>

    <p><strong>Anomalous Entity Classification</strong> is a system that serves to better document the habitual features of <a>anomalous entities</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Class A</h2>
    <p>can reproduce, ecosystem</p>
    
    <h2>Class B</h2>
    <p>can't reproduce, typically of man-made origin</p>

    <h2>Class C</h2>
    <p>only one exists</p>

    <h2>Class CU</h2>
    <p>unknown if only one exists</p>
  
    <h2>Class H</h2>
    <strong>Class H</strong> entities are hypothetical anomalous entities that have not been directly observed but are known to exist due to their effect on their environment.
