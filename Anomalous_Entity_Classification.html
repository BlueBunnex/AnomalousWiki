    <h1>Anomalous Entity Classification</h1>

    <p><strong>Anomalous Entity Classification</strong> is a system that serves to better document the distribution of <a>anomalous entities</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Class A</h2>
    <p><strong>Class A</strong> entities are capable of reproduction and are typically integrated into the ecosystem in a similar way to animals.</p>
    
    <h2>Class B</h2>
    <p><strong>Class B</strong> entities are incapable of reproduction and so their origin is typically artificial/man-made.</p>

    <h2>Class C</h2>
    <p>Entities classified under <strong>Class C</strong> have been found to, due to some property, only exist as a sole individual within the entire universe. These include beings that support a universal law (such as the <a>Medulla</a> with the expansion of the universe), Jane Rieler's god (as proposed in her <a href="Doll_machine">doll machine</a> thought experiment), and so forth.</p>

    <h2>Class CU</h2>
    <p>Similar to Class C entities, only one <strong>Class CU</strong> entity of a given type exists, the difference being its uniqueness has yet been proven to be true. The formation of this classification is from <i>Class C</i> and the letter <i>U</i> representing "Unknown."</p>
  
    <h2>Plus H</h2>
    <p><strong>Plus H</strong> is a class modifier (written in the form <i>Class C+H</i>) that describes hypothetical anomalous entities. It maintain's the base classes description, but with the addition that they have not been directly observed but are known to exist due to their effect on their environment.</p>
