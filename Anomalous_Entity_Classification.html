    <h1>Anomalous Entity Classification</h1>

    <p><strong>Anomalous Entity Classification</strong> is a system that serves to better document the habitual features of <a>anomalous entities</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Class A</h2>
    <p><strong>Class A</strong> entities are capable of reproduction and are typically integrated into the ecosystem in a similar way to animals.</p>
    
    <h2>Class B</h2>
    <p>_. They are notable for their inability to reproduce, and so their origin is typically artificial/man-made.</p>

    <h2>Class C</h2>
    <p>Entities classified under <strong>Class C</strong> have been found to, due to some property, only exist as a sole individual within the entire universe. These include beings that support a universal law (such as the <a>Medulla</a> with the expansion of the universe), Jane Rieler's god (as proposed in her <a href="Doll_machine">doll machine</a> thought experiment), and so forth.</p>

    <h2>Class CU</h2>
    <p>Similar to Class C entities, only one <strong>Class CU</strong> entity of a given type exists, the difference being its uniqueness has yet been proven to be true. The formation of this classification is from <i>Class C</i> and the letter <i>U</i> representing "Unknown."</p>
  
    <h2>Class H</h2>
    <strong>Class H</strong> entities are hypothetical anomalous entities that have not been directly observed but are known to exist due to their effect on their environment.
