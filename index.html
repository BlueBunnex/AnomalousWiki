    <h1>Skinwalkers</h1>
    
    <p>Skinwalkers are a Class-A anomalous entity in the category Homoanalogae. They have the ability to — after a short period of observation — mimic the speech of humans it encounters. They resemble animals and in rare instances humans, albeit with notable deformities.</p>
    <p>Skinwalkers have been shown to not pass the <a href="">Boering-Rieler Test</a> of consciousness.</p>
    
    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
    
    <h2>Behaviour</h2>
    <p>Skinwalkers — like humans and their ancestors — are endurance hunters, pursuing their prey to the point of exhaustion where they are then killed and consumed.</p>
