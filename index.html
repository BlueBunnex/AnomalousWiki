    <h1>Molly, my beemomma sona</h1>
    <p>Cuddles every night 'cuz she's romantic and sweet like honey. She's low maintenance and diligent, but loves you.</p>
    
    <h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>Unlike a true bee, Molly is a frugivore and thus her diet consists of entirely sweet fruits, as well as honey during the cold season when her metabolism slows down. Under optimal conditions, she can produce honey exceeding 5 gal/day.</p>
    <p>If she overeats she might get so big that she can't move very well. If she's not near her hive, she doesn't like to waste, so you might have to grab some containers.</p>
