    <h1>Molly, my beemomma sona</h1>
    <p>She's low maintenance and diligent, but always makes time for you. A bit of a romantic nut, she cuddles every night.</p>
    <p>On Fridays she cracks open a cask of her own fruity mead and settles in for the night.</p>
    
    <h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>Unlike a true bee, Molly is a frugivore and thus her diet consists of entirely sweet fruits, as well as honey during the cold season when her metabolism slows down. Under optimal conditions, she can produce honey exceeding 5 gal/day.</p>
    <p>When she overeats she can get so big that she can't move very well. If she's not near her hive, she doesn't like to waste, so you might have to grab some containers.</p>
    
    <h2>Assets</h2>

            <td>Actually just a repurposed barn. Can store up to 150 barrels of honey. The floor is noticably tacky.</td>
