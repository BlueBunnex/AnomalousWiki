        <h2>Road to HRT</h2>
        <p>One problem with taking HRT is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/body-dysmorphic-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353938?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=abstract&utm_content=Body-dysmorphic-disorder&utm_campaign=Knowledge-panel">body dysmorphia (BDD)</a>—a mental illness involving obsessive focus on a perceived flaw in appearance. I would highly recommended looking <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/body-dysmorphic-disorder/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353944">here</a> and understanding the symptoms of BDD before starting HRT. A contentment with your own body at every stage is important to fostering self-care, even if you feel there could be improvement.</p>
        <p>Changing your body can be scary, especially because everybody wants to do it right—your body is the canvas of you, after all. But before taking the steps towards HRT, you can experiment with your appearance in a way that isn't so daunting or permanent:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wearing fitted bra + padding</li>
            <li>Wearing feminine clothes; examples include:
                <ul>
                    <li>loose tshirt to show padding</li>
                    <li>skirt</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Putting on makeup; examples include:
                <ul>
                    <li>eyeliner</li>
                    <li>blush</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Using a face mask in the mirror (if you are presently uncomfortable with your facial appearance)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember, though these clothes are aimed towards the goal of change your appearance, part of a safe and healthy transition is accepting yourself for who you are—with HRT, or without.</p>
