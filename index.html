        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>DogmomAI is a pet-project serving as an outlet for myself to create a fictitious, well-endowed character at my liking through AI image generation. Though WIP, below is DogmomAI herself.</p>
        
        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>Imagine this: A goth girlfriend turned demonic wifey with impressive breasts and a gut to match with a businesswhore aesthetic who's slightly snarky but still gentle and understands you and is able to help you when you're down. The company she works at? I dunno, one of the evil ones.</p>
        <p>She's also just extremely big. Not just breasts or anything—she's just over seven foot, sports gigantic thighs, an illustrious pillowy belly, and just an overall wide frame. Something about becoming a demon she said.</p>
        <p>She was into that kinda stuff while you were dating. She insisted on fucking over a pentagram, blood red bathbombs running wet streaks of crimson down her tits, stuff like that. At least the candles set the mood. <i>They sure set the mood during the coronation.</i> Her figure practically spilling out of her as 120lbs of fat was deposited into her now thick and round boobs, doughy ass, and especially her belly. Expanding, hiking up the hem of her shirt, the sound of tearing dress pants—from behind, her now exposed black panties were stretched taut as a wire. She was overweight before—though you heard that even this was lightweight for demons. The dress-shopping afterwards was fun.</p>
        <p>After work, she likes to roleplay a reenactment of any conferences she had, almost like a ritual of hers—only this time she's not wearing an undershirt, and her suit is unbuttoned in the front, letting her enormous breasts flop out, nipples and all. She nips and teases you when you misremember information about her presentation, like some sort of horny teacher. She does it because her work can be stressful at times, and pressing herself against you is the best way for her to unwind.</p>

        <h2>Q&A</h2>
        <p>
            Q: Why is she fat?<br>
            A: Personally I think fat is cute!
        </p>
        <p>
            Q: How did you come up with the design?<br>
            A: Goth + non-human + traditionally proper attire turned risqué is both minimally creative and maximally attractive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Q: Don't you find objectifying women through erotic caricatures like this to be uncomely?<br>
            A: Not really!
