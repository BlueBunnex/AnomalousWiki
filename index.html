    <p>Plucky, squishy healing mage lady that only knows one really minor healing spell. Her robes are machine washable and sometimes get caught within the folds of her body. She suffers from horrible anxiety and requires someone by her side at all times, hence the occupation.</p>

        <li><i>Vem Varis</i> / A minor healing spell often learned by mothers to tend to their children's scrapes and bruises. Mana consumed is negligible but non-zero.</li>
