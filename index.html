    Skinwalkers are a Class-A anomalous entity in the category Hominoanalogae. They have the ability to — after a short period of observation — mimic the speech of humans it encounters. They resemble animals and in rare instances humans, albeit with notable deformities.
    Skinwalkers — like humans and their ancestors — are endurance hunters, stalking their prey to exhaustion where they are then killed and consumed.
