    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>Sara was 4'8", 78lbs, and depressed. She had friends, she supposed, but she didn't feel particularly close to any of them. The lounged in her dingy room all day, blinds drawn, pittering her thin fingers against her keyboard to fawn for men whose interest in her disappeared in front of her face. She wore a black tanktop around the house, and her sides were always cold. Her feeble A cups didn't even show out the sides. Her hips were so pathetic they ran in line with her torso.</p>

    but for that she would have to get dressed and go out. As she did, her eyes widened--her bra that used to fit snugly now felt tight against her breasts. Moreover, her jeans pushed a ring of fat around her hips into a noticeable muffin top. She gasped, spun to the mirror in her room, upon which she had thrown a pair of sweatpants so she wouldn't have to look at herself. She pulled it off, and lo and behold... she had hips. Round, fat, curvy hips--not the most impressive by any means, but they were there.-->
    <!-- deposited into her once flat ass, ballooning to now grotesque enormity, hiking her skirt up and up her rear until her underwear was visible straining against her rear, tight as cord. -->
