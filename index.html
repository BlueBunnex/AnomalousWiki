    Wendigo are a .... that once inhabited Northern America.
    The last wild wendigo sighting was in 2005. It is unknown if they continue to exist in the wild.
    
    Shortcomings
    the test requires the subject be capable of locomotion; this effectively excludes plants from testing.
    The test also requires two creatures to interact with each other, thus excluding Class-C entities. (one where there is only one in existence, no reproduction etc)

    Procedure
    two halls, near the end of either is an electronic screen displaying the end of the other as if it were being viewed from that hallway. a member of the species being tested is restrained such that they can look down both hallways, then another member is killed at the end of one hallway. the restrained member is then let free to run down one hallway of their choice. if they pick the one with the screen depicting the death, they are conscious. if they pick the one that actually has the death but merely displays a blank area, they are consciousless.
    Boering and Rieler have only speculated on why this is the case, saying ...
    
    A Doll Machine is a hypothetical contraption first described by Jane Rieler in 2006 that takes in inorganic matter and creates a living, albeit consciousless, creature.
    Rieler uses the term doll as an analogy for "something that resembles a conscious being, but isn't one itself."
