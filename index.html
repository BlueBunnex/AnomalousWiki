    <br><u>Molly, my catbee momma sona</u>
    <p>Beeautiful Obeese Bee eats Beesauce, cuddles every night and stuff, super romantic and also super sweet (like honey), engorged round belly and tail, low maintenance but loves you 🐝</p>
    <p>Molly is ever diligant in keeping her hive fed, though her flights to and fro may be a bit bumbling. One time, she supplied her hive with 5 gallons of bee sauce all by herself! Sometimes, she gets too hungry and dips her fingers in the bee sauce — it usually ends up being handfuls instead of just finger samples though. But she isn’t ashamed, in fact, she’s quite forward in letting her weight show her love to others. After all, who wouldn’t be open about their “beeautiful” body?</p>
