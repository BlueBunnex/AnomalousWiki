        <p>Amy really wanted to buy a new videogame, and with other things she also needed money for she thought picking up a service job wouldn't be a bad idea. She always stutters when taking people's orders, and she often messes up even the most simple ones, but for some reason she gets tipped well anyways.</p>

        <p>You and your girlfriend Tai Lo decided to have a little fun and snuck around campus after hours, and she was giggling the entire time. You crept into a lecture hall and checked the back door — all clear. As you turned around, she was suddenly half naked, rubbing her jiggling bottom across a school chair. "Wanna do it right now? Right here?"</p>
