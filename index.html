            <p>This is my comically fat dragon character named <strong>Futodoshi</strong> (フトドシ). She runs a small restaurant with her crew, and is often strained to make ends meet.</p>
            <p>Her design is sort of fluid. She is not supposed to be particularly sexy, just big.</p>
            <p>I took inspiration from <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/hiryu-seiruri">this artist</a>. I like their style a lot.</p>
