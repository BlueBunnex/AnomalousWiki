            <small>aka my many ocs</small>
            
            <h3>Beth John Mayer</h3>
            <q>Touch my boobs. I DARE you. These girls are the nuclear launch codes of MY FIST into YOUR FACE.</q>
            <p>Wears sweaty jeggings, a rabbit ear hat (that she refuses to take off), and is constantly high on something. She's thin, got 0 ass, and 2 tits. Fucking hates Gabriela "cuz she's such a coddled bitch."</p>
            <p>Is one of those college videogame streamers that plays with her friends (none of whom live in the blorp house), and is actually pretty popular. Talks mean game too. Seriously, the way she screams at you for calling her a woman you'd think it was a slur.</p>
            <img src="housepngs/beth.png">

            <h3>Gabriela Paul Fitzgerald</h3>
            <q>Algo y algo me gustan los tacos! That means: I don't know Spanish!</q>
            <p>Half African American half Mexican, fat af, wears a lot of yellow/orange. Sweetest resident of the blorp house, but has Bipolar II Disorder and can be usually be found somewhere on the floor. Is terrified by Beth, except during mania where she once almost got herself shivved.</p>
            <p>Her boyfriend spends the night every Friday, and he always buys a whole thing of cookies for everyone in the house to share. Beth is indifferent to him and takes a cookie like everyone else. Gabriela usually has at least four.</p>
            <p>When she's not having a depressive episode, you can find her on the couch in the common area watching YouTube on the big screen — she's one of the few residents who leaves her room for recreation.</p>

            <h3>Charlotte Renarde René</h3>
            <q>If this was some anime I'd probably envy Beth for her giant tits, but it's not and so I don't.</q>
            <q>You think I should get a snake tattooed on my ass? ...Yes, I have an ass.</q>
            <p>Usually walks around the house in only underwear (to everyone's collective disapproval). Tall as fuck, has a potbelly, and is also incessantly goth. You can hear her moaning from inside the bathroom at night — she's the reason the "not before 10pm" policy was established.</p>
            <p>Unlike Beth who smokes, everyone genuinely believes that Carlotte shoots heroin. No one knows for sure, but everyone who cares for her even a little keeps a thing of Narcan in their room should the need ever arise. Gabriela was the only one stupid enough to personally present her with the stuff, which she accepted awkwardly.</p>
            <p>When she finds Gabriela watching YouTube on the couch alone, Charlotte will lean against her and watch too. The couch is long enough to fit four people comfortably, but hey, Gab doesn't mind.</p>
