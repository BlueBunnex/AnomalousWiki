    <br><u>Molly, my catbee momma sona</u>
    <p>average bee color, round belly engorged with beesauce, engorged tail, she's so cutesy 🐝</p>
    <p>She’s a good worker, keeping her hive alive, though her flight may be a bit bumbling. One time, she supplied her hive with 5 gallons of bee sauce all by herself! Also the type to keep it romantical, but she keeps it sweet like honey! Sometimes, she gets too hungry and dips her fingers in the bee sauce — it usually ends up being handfuls instead of just finger samples though. Her cuddles are to die for, along with her appetite. But she isn’t ashamed, in fact, she’s quite forward to let her weight show her love to others. After all, who wouldn’t be open about their “beeautiful” body?</p>
