    <h1>DogmomAI</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website, where I collage art of my favourite OCs as an incentive to keep drawing them. Every time I draw a sexualized character I take a shot (of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid">silly juice</a>).</p>

    <details><summary>Narrative</summary>
        <p>Through the door slid a grand, sinewy woman—and in every sense she was a woman, from the shape of her face and body to the mannerism she carried with her. The lounge was grey and silent, not empty—despite this her figure arched with motion, muscles tightening and flexing beneath grey skin, subtly dancing through the space that was otherwise abiotic and corperate. She let herself fall against a table, her body's only softness undulating briefly within the confines of her top as it came to rest atop the counter, next to which you had, until this point, sat undisturbed. Without her even have to look at you, give you her attention, you put away your phone, and when she did turn to you, slowly, she smirked like a dragon.</p>
        <p>"Hey," she sweetly hissed. "I'm new here, you?" What intricate experience had crafted a woman of this granduer only to place her here in front of you, you wondered? It was of no matter, however, because just as quickly as soon as she turned to you she looked back, seeming disinterested in your apparent wordlessness. Wait, you thought, and stirred, and she felt this and turned, eager, and you spoke in greeting.</p>
