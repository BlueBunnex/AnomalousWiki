    <h1>Skinwalkers</h1>
    <img style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; width: 35%;" src="https://townsquare.media/site/532/files/2023/03/attachment-Skinwalker1.jpg">
    
    <p>Skinwalkers are a <a href="">Class-A</a> <a href="">anomalous entity</a> in the category <a href="">Homoanalogae</a>.</p>
    <p>Skinwalkers have been shown to not pass the <a href="">Boering-Rieler Test</a> of consciousness.</p>
    
    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <p>Skinwalkers appearance varies between individuals, resembling animals or humans with notable deformities. These deformities include lengthened fingers, missing limbs, extra limbs, dislocated jaw, missing jaw, absence of pigmentation in the skin, etc.</p>
    <p>Skinwalkers are characterized by their gaunt appearance as a result of extremely low body fat percentages. Analysis of cadavers recovered from investigations into hotspots reveal body fat typically below 2%, with body fat concentrated in the trunk around vital organs and almost absent in the outer extremities.</p>
    
    <h2>Behaviour</h2>
    <p>Skinwalkers—like humans and their ancestors—are endurance hunters, pursuing their prey to the point of exhaustion where they are then killed and consumed.</p>
    <p>Skinwalkers have the ability to—after a short period of observation—mimic the speech of humans it has encountered.</p>
